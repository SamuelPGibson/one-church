## WHAT I WAS ABLE TO GET FROM CHATGPT üö® 

# OneChurch Fullstack Guide

### Section 2: Backend Setup & Prisma Models

---

## üîß PART 2: BACKEND SETUP (Node.js + Express + Prisma)

### Step 1: Initialize Backend Project

```bash
mkdir onechurch-backend
cd onechurch-backend
npm init -y
npm install express cors dotenv prisma @prisma/client

```

### Step 2: Initialize Prisma ORM

```bash
npx prisma init

```

This creates a `prisma` folder with `schema.prisma` and a `.env` file.

---

### Step 3: Configure Database Connection

Edit `.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection string:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/onechurch"

```

Replace `user`, `password`, and database name as per your setup.

---

### Step 4: Define Prisma Schema Models

Edit `prisma/schema.prisma` to define your database tables. Here's a recommended schema for OneChurch:

```
generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

model User {
  id          Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  email       String    @unique
  password    String    // hashed password
  name        String?
  isChurch    Boolean   @default(false)
  profilePic  String?   // URL to profile picture
  bio         String?
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  posts       Post[]
  followers   Follower[] @relation("UserFollowers")
  following   Follower[] @relation("UserFollowing")
  messagesSent Message[] @relation("MessagesSent")
  messagesReceived Message[] @relation("MessagesReceived")
  events      Event[]   @relation("EventCreator")
}

model Post {
  id          Int       @id @default(autoincrement())
  author      User      @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId    Int
  content     String
  mediaUrls   String[]  @default([])  // list of image/video URLs
  createdAt   DateTime  @default(now())
  likes       Like[]
  comments    Comment[]
}
id
model Like {
  id      Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  user    User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId  Int
  post    Post   @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
  postId  Int

  @@unique([userId, postId])
}

model Comment {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  post      Post     @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
  postId    Int
  author    User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  authorId  Int
  content   String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
}

model Follower {
  id          Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  follower    User   @relation("UserFollowing", fields: [followerId], references: [id])
  followerId  Int
  following   User   @relation("UserFollowers", fields: [followingId], references: [id])
  followingId Int

  @@unique([followerId, followingId])
}

model Message {
  id            Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  sender        User     @relation("MessagesSent", fields: [senderId], references: [id])
  senderId      Int
  receiver      User     @relation("MessagesReceived", fields: [receiverId], references: [id])
  receiverId    Int
  content       String
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  read          Boolean  @default(false)
}

model Event {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  creator     User     @relation("EventCreator", fields: [creatorId], references: [id])
  creatorId   Int
  title       String
  description String
  startDate   DateTime
  endDate     DateTime
  location    String?
  attendees   User[]   @relation("EventAttendees", references: [id])
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
}

model EventAttendees {
  id        Int    @id @default(autoincrement())
  event     Event  @relation(fields: [eventId], references: [id])
  eventId   Int
  user      User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  userId    Int

  @@unique([eventId, userId])
}

```

**Notes:**

- The `User` model has a boolean `isChurch` to distinguish personal accounts vs church/org accounts.
- `Post` can have text and media URLs.
- `Follower` models the many-to-many follow relationship between users.
- `Message` supports private messaging.
- `Event` and `EventAttendees` support church events and RSVPs.

---

### Step 5: Push Prisma Schema to Database

Run this command to create tables in your database:

```bash
npx prisma db push

```

---

### Step 6: Generate Prisma Client

```bash
npx prisma generate

```

---

### Step 7: Create Basic Express Server

Create `server.js` in your backend folder:

```
require('dotenv').config();
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const { PrismaClient } = require('@prisma/client');

const app = express();
const prisma = new PrismaClient();

app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('OneChurch backend running');
});

// Example route to get all users
app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
  res.json(users);
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
});

```

---

### What‚Äôs Next?

- Build out routes for posts, followers, messages, and events
- Implement authentication and authorization (covered in next section)
- Connect backend with frontend

---

Would you like me to continue with Section 3: Authentication & Authorization?

Here‚Äôs **Section 3: Authentication & Authorization** for your OneChurch project.

---

# OneChurch Fullstack Guide

### Section 3: Authentication & Authorization

---

## üîê PART 3: USER AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION

OneChurch requires user accounts for both individuals and churches, secure login, and protected routes.

---

### Option 1: Using Clerk.dev (Recommended for React)

**Setup:**

1. Go to [https://clerk.dev](https://clerk.dev/) and sign up for a free account.
2. Create a new application in the Clerk dashboard.
3. Copy your Clerk frontend API key.

---

**Install Clerk SDK in frontend:**

```bash
npm install @clerk/clerk-react

```

---

**Wrap your React app with ClerkProvider:**

In `main.jsx`:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react';
import App from './App';

const clerkFrontendApi = 'your-clerk-frontend-api'; // from Clerk dashboard

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <ClerkProvider frontendApi={clerkFrontendApi}>
    <App />
  </ClerkProvider>
);

```

---

**Protect routes and get user info:**

In `App.jsx` or specific pages:

```jsx
import { SignedIn, SignedOut, UserButton } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

function NavBar() {
  return (
    <nav>
      <SignedIn>
        <UserButton />
      </SignedIn>
      <SignedOut>
        <a href="/sign-in">Sign In</a>
      </SignedOut>
    </nav>
  );
}

```

---

**Add Clerk React components for sign-in/sign-up:**

Create pages `/sign-in.jsx` and `/sign-up.jsx` with Clerk‚Äôs pre-built components:

```jsx
import { SignIn } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

export default function SignInPage() {
  return <SignIn />;
}

```

Similarly for `SignUp`.

---

**Backend Integration:**

- Use Clerk middleware or verify tokens on backend to secure API routes.
- In Express, verify the `Authorization` header with Clerk SDK.

Example:

```
const { auth } = require('@clerk/clerk-sdk-node');

app.use(async (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization;
  if (!token) return res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');

  try {
    const verified = await auth.verifyToken(token);
    req.userId = verified.sub; // use this for DB queries
    next();
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(401).send('Unauthorized');
  }
});

```

---

### Option 2: Firebase Authentication (Alternative)

- Setup Firebase project and enable Email/Password or other providers.
- Use Firebase SDK on frontend for login/signup.
- Use Firebase Admin SDK on backend to verify tokens.

---

### Option 3: Manual Authentication (Email + Password + JWT)

- Use bcrypt for hashing passwords.
- Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for sessions.
- Build login, signup, and protected routes manually.

---

### Best Practices

- Never store plain passwords; always hash.
- Use HTTPS for all requests.
- Protect backend routes by verifying auth tokens.
- Store tokens securely on the client (e.g., HttpOnly cookies or localStorage carefully).

---

### Next Steps

- Implement auth-protected CRUD routes for Posts, Events, Messaging.
- Connect frontend user sessions with backend authorization.

---

Would you like me to continue with Section 4: Media Uploads & Real-Time Messaging?

Here‚Äôs **Section 4: Media Uploads & Real-Time Messaging** for your OneChurch project.

---

# OneChurch Fullstack Guide

### Section 4: Media Uploads & Real-Time Messaging

---

## üì∏ PART 4: MEDIA UPLOADS

Users and churches will want to upload images and videos for posts and profiles.

---

### Option 1: Using Cloudinary

**Setup:**

1. Sign up at [https://cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com/) and create a free account.
2. Get your **Cloud name**, **API Key**, and **API Secret** from your dashboard.

---

**Backend:**

Install Cloudinary SDK:

```bash
npm install cloudinary multer multer-storage-cloudinary

```

Create a Cloudinary config file (e.g., `cloudinary.js`):

```
const cloudinary = require('cloudinary').v2;

cloudinary.config({
  cloud_name: process.env.CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME,
  api_key: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_KEY,
  api_secret: process.env.CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET,
});

module.exports = cloudinary;

```

Set environment variables in `.env`.

---

**File Upload Middleware with Multer:**

```
const multer = require('multer');
const { CloudinaryStorage } = require('multer-storage-cloudinary');
const cloudinary = require('./cloudinary');

const storage = new CloudinaryStorage({
  cloudinary: cloudinary,
  params: {
    folder: 'onechurch',
    allowed_formats: ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'mp4', 'mov'],
  },
});

const parser = multer({ storage: storage });

module.exports = parser;

```

---

**Express route example:**

```
const parser = require('./path/to/parser');

app.post('/upload', parser.single('media'), (req, res) => {
  // req.file contains uploaded file info
  res.json({ url: req.file.path }); // send back Cloudinary URL
});

```

---

**Frontend:**

Use a file input, send the file with `FormData` to `/upload`, and get back the URL. Store that URL in your post record.

---

### Option 2: Firebase Storage

- Setup Firebase Storage in your Firebase project.
- Use Firebase SDK to upload files directly from frontend.
- Store returned URLs in your backend DB.

---

## üí¨ PART 5: REAL-TIME MESSAGING

---

### Option 1: Socket.IO

**Backend:**

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install socket.io

```

Modify your `server.js`:

```
const http = require('http');
const { Server } = require('socket.io');

const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server, {
  cors: { origin: '*' },
});

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  console.log('User connected:', socket.id);

  socket.on('sendMessage', (message) => {
    // Broadcast to receiver or all clients
    io.emit('receiveMessage', message);
  });

  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('User disconnected:', socket.id);
  });
});

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server with Socket.IO running on port ${PORT}`);
});

```

---

**Frontend:**

Install:

```bash
npm install socket.io-client

```

Use in React component:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('http://localhost:5000');

function Chat() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    socket.on('receiveMessage', (message) => {
      setMessages((prev) => [...prev, message]);
    });
    return () => socket.off('receiveMessage');
  }, []);

  const sendMessage = () => {
    socket.emit('sendMessage', input);
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <>
      <div>
        {messages.map((msg, i) => (
          <p key={i}>{msg}</p>
        ))}
      </div>
      <input value={input} onChange={e => setInput(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={sendMessage}>Send</button>
    </>
  );
}

```

---

### Option 2: Firebase Realtime Database

- Use Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore to sync messages live.
- Leverage Firebase SDK on frontend to listen to messages and send new ones.

---

## Summary

| Feature | Tool | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Media Uploads | Cloudinary / Firebase Storage | Store media URLs in DB |
| Real-time Messaging | Socket.IO / Firebase | Real-time private messaging |

Would you like me to help create code snippets or design ideas for any of these features? Or shall we work on finalizing your project documentation?

Got it! Here‚Äôs a focused plan with essential **code snippets and explanations** to get your **MVP** solid and functional for OneChurch:

---

# OneChurch MVP Essentials: Key Code Snippets & Guidance

---

## 1. User Authentication (Using Clerk)

**Frontend Setup:**

```bash
npm install @clerk/clerk-react

```

In `main.jsx`:

```jsx
import { ClerkProvider } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

const clerkFrontendApi = "your-clerk-frontend-api";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <ClerkProvider frontendApi={clerkFrontendApi}>
    <App />
  </ClerkProvider>
);

```

Protect routes in `App.jsx`:

```jsx
import { SignedIn, SignedOut, SignIn, SignUp } from '@clerk/clerk-react';

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <SignedIn>
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<Feed />} />
          {/* other routes */}
        </Routes>
      </SignedIn>
      <SignedOut>
        <SignIn />
      </SignedOut>
    </>
  );
}

```

---

## 2. Backend Models (Prisma)

`schema.prisma` (simplified MVP):

```
model User {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  email       String   @unique
  name        String?
  isChurch    Boolean  @default(false)
  posts       Post[]
  followers   Follower[] @relation("UserFollowers")
  following   Follower[] @relation("UserFollowing")
}

model Post {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  authorId  String
  content   String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  user      User     @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
  likes     Like[]
  comments  Comment[]
}

model Like {
  id      String @id @default(cuid())
  postId  String
  userId  String
  post    Post   @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
  user    User   @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}

model Comment {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  postId    String
  userId    String
  content   String
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  post      Post     @relation(fields: [postId], references: [id])
  user      User     @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}

model Follower {
  id          String @id @default(cuid())
  followerId  String
  followingId String
  follower    User   @relation("UserFollowing", fields: [followerId], references: [id])
  following   User   @relation("UserFollowers", fields: [followingId], references: [id])
}

```

---

## 3. Backend API Example (Express + Prisma)

Basic posts endpoint:

```
app.get('/posts', async (req, res) => {
  const posts = await prisma.post.findMany({
    include: {
      user: true,
      likes: true,
      comments: true,
    },
    orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' }
  });
  res.json(posts);
});

app.post('/posts', async (req, res) => {
  const { authorId, content } = req.body;
  const post = await prisma.post.create({
    data: { authorId, content }
  });
  res.json(post);
});

```

## 4. Frontend: Fetch & Display Posts (React)

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Feed() {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('https://your-backend.com/posts')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => setPosts(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <div key={post.id} className="post-card">
          <h3>{post.user.name || "Anonymous"}</h3>
          <p>{post.content}</p>
          <small>{new Date(post.createdAt).toLocaleString()}</small>
        </div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}

```

## 5. Real-Time Messaging (Socket.IO MVP)

Backend snippet:

```
const http = require('http');
const { Server } = require('socket.io');
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = new Server(server, { cors: { origin: '*' } });

io.on('connection', socket => {
  console.log('User connected:', socket.id);

  socket.on('message', msg => {
    io.emit('message', msg);
  });
});

server.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`));

```

Frontend snippet:

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

const socket = io('https://your-backend.com');

function Chat() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState([]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    socket.on('message', msg => setMessages(prev => [...prev, msg]));
    return () => socket.off('message');
  }, []);

  const sendMessage = () => {
    socket.emit('message', input);
    setInput('');
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div className="messages">
        {messages.map((msg, i) => <p key={i}>{msg}</p>)}
      </div>
      <input value={input} onChange={e => setInput(e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={sendMessage}>Send</button>
    </div>
  );
}

```

## 6. Basic Event Posting (Backend Model + API)

Add this to your Prisma schema:

```
model Event {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  churchId    String
  title       String
  description String?
  startTime   DateTime
  endTime     DateTime
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  church      User     @relation(fields: [churchId], references: [id])
}

```

API endpoints example:

```
app.get('/events', async (req, res) => {
  const events = await prisma.event.findMany({ orderBy: { startTime: 'asc' } });
  res.json(events);
});

app.post('/events', async (req, res) => {
  const { churchId, title, description, startTime, endTime } = req.body;
  const event = await prisma.event.create({
    data: { churchId, title, description, startTime: new Date(startTime), endTime: new Date(endTime) }
  });
  res.json(event);
});

```
